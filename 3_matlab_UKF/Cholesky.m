function A=Cholesky(A)
% Cholesky Factorization for symmetric positive definite matrix
% Algorithm 2.7 Heath, p.86
% Factorize A such that A = L*L',
% where L is a lower triangular matrix whose diagonal entries are not
% necessarily unity
% In the output the lower triangular part of A is over-written by L
% The upper triangular part of A is left unchanged and 
% has no significance
